## Key Features

- **Creation of Mind Maps:** Users can easily create new mind maps by specifying the name and, if necessary, a description.

- **Map Management:** Existing mind maps can be viewed, edited, and deleted directly from the application interface.

- **Creation of Parent Nodes:** For each mind map, users can insert parent nodes, representing key concepts or topics. Each parent node can be described with a name and description.

- **Creation of Child Nodes:** To further expand information, users can add child nodes to each parent node. These child nodes are hierarchically linked and can contain a name and description.

- **Intuitive Navigation:** Navigation within mind maps is intuitive: users can expand or collapse child nodes connected to parent nodes to explore information.

- **Deletion:** Mind maps, parent nodes, and child nodes can be deleted when no longer needed.

- **User-Friendly User Interface:** The application's interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to focus on creating and organizing mind maps.

- **Secure Storage:** All mind maps and related data are securely stored in the application's database.
